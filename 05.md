## continue on pointers
- multiple pointer -> multiple ownership
- borrowing is the pointer
- smart pointer is reference counting 
- rc in rust is smart pointer
- there is only pass by reference in c 
- pass by value is in c++ and rust but not recommended 
- pass by value for large DS like array cause lots of computation
- dereference: 
```c
data = &test;
printf("%d\n", *data);
``` 
- void pointers can't be dereference 
- void pointers are used for generics, functions which get and pass pointers :
```bash
man malloc 
# give me 10byte and return me address 
# void *malloc(size_t size)

# or 
# void free(void *ptr)
# it frees the memory doesn't matter the type
```
or 
```bash
man 2 read

#ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
# read 10 byte and put it in buf and the buf data type doesn't matter
```
or 
```
man qsort
```

## lvalue, rvalue, lrvalue
lvalue :
```c
*ptr = 50;
```
rvalue:
```
int v = *ptr;
```
