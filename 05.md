## continue on pointers
- multiple pointer -> multiple ownership
- borrowing is the pointer
- smart pointer is reference counting 
- rc in rust is smart pointer
- there is only pass by reference in c 
- pass by value is in c++ and rust but not recommended 
- pass by value for large DS like array cause lots of computation
- dereference: 
```c
data = &test;
printf("%d\n", *data);
``` 
- void pointers can't be dereference 
- void pointers are used for generics, functions which get and pass pointers :
```bash
man malloc 
# give me 10byte and return me address 
# void *malloc(size_t size)

# or 
# void free(void *ptr)
# it frees the memory doesn't matter the type
```
or 
```bash
man 2 read

#ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
# read 10 byte and put it in buf and the buf data type doesn't matter
```
or 
```
man qsort
```

## lvalue, rvalue, lrvalue
lvalue :
```c
*ptr = 50;
```
rvalue:
```
int v = *ptr;
```

### in C you must always pass the array size
see strcpy, qsort, write (man 2 write ) implementations

- you can also use structure

### c doesn't care about where you read, but OS have some segment in memory (attack or bug) OS stop your program ( c doesn't have runtime to stop your program)
```
print_array(A,20000);
```
echo $? 139

---------
 
 in linux the process with pid 1 is: ( is service manager of linux )
 - in old systems : /sbin/init( init system)
 - in redhat based : /lib/systemd( systemd system)
 - canonical tried to build upstart but failed (although seems like chormeOS is using it)
 - [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/taubvb/seems_like_chrome_os_still_uses_upstart/)
---- 
 loading process:
 - bootloader by bios(grub) is loaded
 - bootloader load kernel in memory
 - kernel bring up first process which is `init`
 ------
 then now
 - startx : bring up x11
 - which bring up (desktop environment) session manager, windows manager
 - e.g. : KDE will bring up plasma shell
 - if you stop process 1 the system will be restart 
 - `init 6` in old linux will restart system
 - thread is a process too.
 - process has independent code, data segment , heap and stack but thread have shared heap, code and data segment  and independent stack
 - if a process exited, parent will notice and do something
 - if your program exit normally will just put status code in `$?` but if because of error and security like segmentation fault , illegal instruction it force to exit, terminal (os) will print the message
 - in freeware  you can do anything, and if you read out of bound regarding your cpu, you will get exception in cpu level or nothing 
- if your process is doing and parent(like terminal) got exited, the child will force exit (by closing systemd, everything will get closed)
- if parent says to os that I am going to close, the child will get orphan and will become child of pid 1 (init) and become a service (creating service by fork)
- if you exit child, os will notify parent and parent should process the message from os, if it doesn't do it, the child is called zombie , because os will not release the resources unless the parent process the closing message from os
- e.g. if the parent blocked on reading network , if the child got exited , the child will become zombie 
- manual services executed in terminal can become services only by forking method
- but by telling systemd you can put it in background 
- the only multi-thread solution before posix thread is fork:
```
man 2 fork
```
- fork is copy on write (lazy loading) , we do it part by part (not instant) and will not cause RAM occupied 2x

## c is two thing:

- don't exceed boundary of your variable
- free the RAM in time

## isolation
- owner of A is main
- responsibility of changing  and deleting A is with main
- so the function should not change the input (reusability and trust)
- in reusability the function shouldn't be dependent on outside variables
- it is standard like OWASP , follow it and if not the responsibility is yours
-  OOP [e.g. Java], event-oriented, functional programming (closure) [e.g. Haksel]
- multi-paradigm  programming lang like cpp both support oop and functional programming
- closure is lambda function (functions with no names that we can call in use)
- in c, function pointers are like Closure
- rust is a rouge one, omitting inheritance ending the arguments and alter both OOP and FP  
--------
### standard
- always in function signature pass the readonly pointers as const
- pointers which are not const will change like `strcpy`
- if we want to return array or structure we will get an pointer as input plate (1-defining local variable  in stack retuning the address cause dangling pointer) (2-defining array in heap and return the address also is wrong and will limit the user and will be engage in heap) 
- **rule 1:** each function allocate something should deallocate too. (ownership)[so using 2. method is wrong because then someone in main should deallocate the heap allocated memory]
- return only can be used for simple DS 
- by using the variable plate method you can return multiple outputs
- in returned value put the successful param like:
```c
if(read(buf,10) != -1)
```
- by this method EAX register will be compared and no RAM is used

## Data type Aliasing 
```c
typedef int mydatatype;
```
- in different systems we have, so we  MACRO if it is x64 we got typedef size_t into long long integer and if x32 typedef it into long integer 
- so by typedef different systems and compile settings we can change things (fast refactor)(meta programming)
- it also is used to use `struct` more easily
```c
struct Data{
    int x,y;
};
typedef struct Data DataT;

DataT D;
```

## compile and link multiple files
- if you have two c codes like one is function implementation and one is main with function declaration, you can use:
```bash
gcc *.c
```
then:
```bash
./a.out
```
- if you want to have septate object files (binary)
```bash
gcc -c helper.c -o helper.o # if you don't pass -c (compile) you will get error because gcc is waiting for main func 
gcc -c main.c -o main.o
gcc *.o -o app # if you pass object file to gcc it will link
```
- `#include "helper.h"` means your local file is prioritize over other header files

## heap allocation

- `malloc` and `free` in c standard library are using `mmap` (memory map) and `munmap` (memory numap) syscalls
- malloc memory is full of garbage, old attack was reading the heap to find passwords in RAM which is not cleared(fuzzing method), now OSs fill the memory with random numbers
- `realloc` doesn't show its performance effect in dev mode, it shows itself in busy systems where there is a ton of allocated memory in heap 
- these are like `new` in cpp
