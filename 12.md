## handling image format in c
-  libpng
-  libjpeg
- libtiff

or use boost or opencv in cpp
for implementing resize in images you need math library:
- in c : OpenBLAS, GSL, LAPACK
- in cpp : it++

for image processing 
- cpp : opencv
- c : [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php)

using cpp in c:
- (monolith app) extern c method : disable overloading and compile cpp like c and load in c => so file
- (microservice) ipc 

- processing binary really needs libraries, tle which for example still takes 2 days to implement
- but text, it is easy you have to find {[]}, but boost for example have json handler library, good exercise (process dns request of logged wireshark to show its data meta verbosely)

[source] --- preprocess(MACRO step is here: META Programming) -> [new source] --- compile -> ASM --- assemble -> binary --- link -> exec

## Meta Programming : programs write programs
- e.g in 32 bit system the data type become long long integer in 64 become long integer (no manual like find replace)

## see preprocess code 
```
gcc -E 12.c -o 12_preprocessed.c
```
you can see all MACROs are find and replaced
