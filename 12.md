## handling image format in c
-  libpng
-  libjpeg
- libtiff

or use boost or opencv in cpp
for implementing resize in images you need math library:
- in c : OpenBLAS, GSL, LAPACK
- in cpp : it++

for image processing 
- cpp : opencv
- c : [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php)

using cpp in c:
- (monolith app) extern c method : disable overloading and compile cpp like c and load in c => so file
- (microservice) ipc 

- processing binary really needs libraries, tle which for example still takes 2 days to implement
- but text, it is easy you have to find {[]}, but boost for example have json handler library, good exercise (process dns request of logged wireshark to show its data meta verbosely)

[source] --- preprocess(MACRO step is here: META Programming) -> [new source] --- compile -> ASM --- assemble -> binary --- link -> exec

## Meta Programming : programs write programs
- e.g in 32 bit system the data type become long long integer in 64 become long integer (no manual like find replace)

## see preprocess code 
```
gcc -E 12.c -o 12_preprocessed.c
```
you can see all MACROs are find and replaced

now if you omit the MACRO you can pass it by -D
```
gcc -E -DPI=10 12.c -o 12_preprocessed.c
```
--with ssl or --with encryption or --with remote-access is good in compilers feature 
you pass in compile time

## MACROs
- are good to turn off and on some features
- or have one codebase for two companies 
- in `cutl` recently added TOR, ipfs
- so in `http` and `https`
- for `https` you need openssl, libcrypt(GNU project), libnsss, gnutls(GNU project)
- OPENWRT is a linux freeware to be installed on network devices (it is shared memory NOT RTOS) then instead of company framework, you install it and can config advanced thing, on Mikrotik mAP you can install but it got only 15mB hard so you need to disable manually many features and compile  yourself(openssl it self is 8MB)
- there is no namespace in c, so MACRO names should be unique

- in compile time you need libraries you use
- in libcurl there is lot of MACRO to use different libraries and be can be compiled

now you can see:
```bash
$ gcc  -D GREET 12.c -o 12
$ ./12
Hello dear user 
PLease enter circle radius: 
```
if you don't pass:
```bash
$ gcc 12.c -o 12
$ ./12
PLease enter circle radius: 
```

- cmake and make are using macro for compile
- esp32 float feature i think is turn off and you can enable it by macro but the binary output become big
- ARM doesn't have hardware floating point division
- we have both `ifdef` and `ifndef`
- you can use `ifndef` to overright defined MACROs

## link review
- if you have source, easiest method is
```
gcc main.c libarea.c -o main
$ ./main
```
- harder method is
```
$ gcc -c main.c -o main.o
$ gcc -c libarea.c -o libarea.o
$ gcc *.o -o main
$ ./main
```

## extern
- extern c, then two .o and then link them
- .so and .o and .a (archive) all same
- .a is package of multiple .o (zip of .o files)
- .so is .o just address are position independent
- you use .so when install library on system  and load on runtime (you then have multiple files)
- you use .a when you in compile time you want to embed library in you code (single output file)

- static link: library combine with your code , bigger binary output but independent, but on library update you need to update application
- dynamic link(.so): os loads library and connect it, and you can update your .so when you like

## see header guards
```
locate stdio.h
```
```
less /usr/include/stdio.h
```

## use MACRO to add features
if you want to use `strstr`
```
man str
```
you should add :
```
#define _GNU_SOURCE
```
it means it is not POSIX anymore or are using GNU standards

you can see that on
```
man feature_test_macro
```

or some even are MACROs for versions
```
man 2 open
```
`openat()` have been added recently
```
Since glibc 2.10:
    _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
Before glibc 2.10:
    _ATFILE_SOURCE
```

so you write
```c
#if _POSIX_C_SOURCE < 299809L
...
#endif
```

- namespace linux in kernel 
have been added since 2 version

busybox linux doesn't have namespace

- file space hole punching is feature from 3.15v
you punch a hole in file system and add data there

so if you want to use it you should check that in `fallocate`



- `sleep(5)` in linux is in `unistd` and windows is in `windows.h`. 
you define this MACRO:
```c
#ifdef _WIN32
#include <windows.h>
#else
#include <unistd.h>
#endif
``` 
- `_WIN32`: windows 32 or 64 (most windows programs are 32)
- `_WIN64`: windows 64
- `__APPLE__`: AppleOs
- `__MACH__`: MacOs
- `__ANDROID__`: Android
- `__unix__`: unix, solaris
- `__linux__`: linux
- `__OpenBSD__`: OpenBSD

like namespace and cgroup are linux specific

### use `#error` and `#warning` for error and warning during compile time


## run time errors
- they are mostly in data
- you read 100 byte from disk but you read 90
- you message is not complete

- in big programs like ngnix, apache , curl 
    - for reporting error you can use `coredump ` but is good for specific clients
    - use logger to stdout 

## ncurses (new curses)
is a library for creating textual user interfaces 

## pass by reference
In languages like C, when you pass a variable to a function, you are typically passing a copy of that variable's value. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. 

but with MACRO you can do it.
like `getmaxy` in `ncurses`

ncurses is mostly in MACRO, it is good and fast but debugging is hard because there is no function isolation

## parallel processing  
- fork (unix only)
- pthread (posix)

# process
- process(standalone)
- thread(code, data, bss ,heap) is shared with main process, it is a light process and only uses 1 core

>  if you don't need i/o, network, bus, memory and are full computation, os gives you turn and whenever os ask you do you have job, you say yes

like :
```c
int main(){
    while(1);
    return 0;
} 
```
but because I am symmetric:
```
uname -a
Linux ubuntu-2204 6.8.0-52-generic #53~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Jan 15 19:18:46 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
OS switches the cores, but only 1 core is 100%

the only method for Multi Process to talk to each other is IPC/RPC:
- ipc is on the same systems (memory share, ...)
- rpc under network for different systems (API, gRPC)

it is hard, so by thread all thread process can use data and no need for ipc/rpc.

in interpreter programs like python, ruby they lock the multithread (GIL) ,because interpreter cant handle it, in compiler languages we only can use that

so why multiprocessor ? because maybe we want to put it on anther system

fork: the process is 1 working as one process suddenly it duplicates itself, it is like `Kage Bunshin no Jutsu` in naruto
