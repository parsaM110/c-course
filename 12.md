## handling image format in c
-  libpng
-  libjpeg
- libtiff

or use boost or opencv in cpp
for implementing resize in images you need math library:
- in c : OpenBLAS, GSL, LAPACK
- in cpp : it++

for image processing 
- cpp : opencv
- c : [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php)

using cpp in c:
- (monolith app) extern c method : disable overloading and compile cpp like c and load in c => so file
- (microservice) ipc 

- processing binary really needs libraries, tle which for example still takes 2 days to implement
- but text, it is easy you have to find {[]}, but boost for example have json handler library, good exercise (process dns request of logged wireshark to show its data meta verbosely)

[source] --- preprocess(MACRO step is here: META Programming) -> [new source] --- compile -> ASM --- assemble -> binary --- link -> exec

## Meta Programming : programs write programs
- e.g in 32 bit system the data type become long long integer in 64 become long integer (no manual like find replace)

## see preprocess code 
```
gcc -E 12.c -o 12_preprocessed.c
```
you can see all MACROs are find and replaced

now if you omit the MACRO you can pass it by -D
```
gcc -E -DPI=10 12.c -o 12_preprocessed.c
```
--with ssl or --with encryption or --with remote-access is good in compilers feature 
you pass in compile time

## MACROs
- are good to turn off and on some features
- or have one codebase for two companies 
- in `cutl` recently added TOR, ipfs
- so in `http` and `https`
- for `https` you need openssl, libcrypt(GNU project), libnsss, gnutls(GNU project)
- OPENWRT is a linux freeware to be installed on network devices (it is shared memory NOT RTOS) then instead of company framework, you install it and can config advanced thing, on Mikrotik mAP you can install but it got only 15mB hard so you need to disable manually many features and compile  yourself(openssl it self is 8MB)

- in compile time you need libraries you use
- in libcurl there is lot of MACRO to use different libraries and be can be compiled

now you can see:
```bash
$ gcc  -D GREET 12.c -o 12
$ ./12
Hello dear user 
PLease enter circle radius: 
```
if you don't pass:
```bash
$ gcc 12.c -o 12
$ ./12
PLease enter circle radius: 
```

- cmake and make are using macro for compile
- esp32 float feature i think is turn off and you can enable it by macro but the binary output become big
- ARM doesn't have hardware floating point division
- we have both `ifdef` and `ifndef`
- you can use `ifndef` to overright defined MACROs
