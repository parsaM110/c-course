-thread 
 - parent exit -> child become orphan and system service
 - fork is lighter than thread 
 - but because dss and stack memory is like shared exit from parent cause exit
 - IPC(shared memory, pipe , unix socket , network socket)
 - global variables can be accesses in threads but it is anti pattern
 - `Green thread` or `Coroutines` is lighter of thread and doesn't get pid and open a process
 - in Green thread you do a network request and then comes back (non blocking) like I/O (escaping bottle neck)
 - rust have Green thread (async) , python and go have
 - but c/cpp don't have them and if you want you should implement yourself:
 ```
man  fopen
man 2 open
```
`open` syscall not libc, have`O_ASYNC` flag and OS gives you this, but you should do it yourself and is manual

in rust have default `Coroutines` :
rust:
```rust
async fn test(){
    reqwest.get("ghj").await(); 
}
```
python:
```python
async def test():
    await aiohttp.get("ghsd") # async http library
```
in js everything is non-blocking (vs c, rust and python which is blocking) and async, because js is generally one-thread, and is executed on browser no thread, so cpu intensive tasks cant be done in js, node.js don't have threads, it is multi-process, node.js is run by something like a server like python  or php, that server duplicate your program and it seems like it is a thread.

rust and c don't have runtime

golang, java and python have runtime, with golang can't run OS.

in python if write async, thread management is your duty but in rust and go they distribute themselves

## random
- encryption key, data for satellite is not good this
- cpp random generator is not good, it is it using Mercen numbers, it is pseudo, random
- in linux you can use `/dev/urandom`
```
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/oo bs=1 count=10
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
10 bytes copied, 0.000172049 s, 58.1 kB/s
$ hexdump -C /tmp/oo
00000000  00 02 26 43 87 04 ab 52  39 51                    |..&C...R9Q|
0000000a
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/oo bs=1 count=10
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
10 bytes copied, 0.000248595 s, 40.2 kB/s
$ hexdump -C /tmp/oo
00000000  be 9e 73 4a 0c 68 3d d9  66 3e                    |..sJ.h=.f>|
0000000a
```

in c :

is not thread safe
`random` func is not random and have IV(initial vector)`in cryptography terms` or better term seed `in PRNG terms`, it is only psudo random means have high entropy and dons't have formula like fibonacci, but is constant:

15  1   4577    5   32

we change starting point: IV or seed 

we seed by `srand` or `srandom` and it is better to be unique and no collision happen(collision in random means radom streams become identical)

so you sync it with time, but two programs at same time they use seed time, they generate identical random numbers, or even if I get the time you run it can generate the number

so mostly use hardware devices for random numbers, or linux device random numbers
```
man 3 random
```
is thread safe:
- doesn't create race condition
- thread are independent
```
man 3 random_r
```
so you can seed independently  for each thread

> number are 2^31 and big in `random` because DS is 64bit but it is unsigned 


## inline 
- MACRO functions
- function call
    - inline(if you can copy and paste the function instead of stack allocation):
    - can't inline recursive function
    - can't inline functions which use static variables(scope is function but lifetime is infinite)
    - can't inline functions with loop
    - some compilers (not clang, gcc) have problem with global variables
    - just remember in your file you should use `static inline`

## finding names in object file
```
gcc -c 08.c -o 08.o
```
now find `generate` in object file:
```
strings 08.o | grep generate 
```
or run
```
nm -an 08.o
```
------
using typdef (always have _)
    - good for dynamic typdef : int for 32 linux, long long for 64 linux
    - easy refactor all variables you use

## sort algorithm
- [ref](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
- see the average column
- buble sort is bad for big data, it is $O(n^2)$
- quick sort is better ,`qsort` implemented by linux (is Generic function, sort everything you give it)-> `void *` is used, it also gets `nmemb` and also `size` because compiler don't know the size, it is generic so you should give it 
- `heapsort` and `mergesort`also by linux is 
implemented

## function pointer
