#session 4

aggregative data structure : Array, Struct, Enum, Union
## Array : 
Sequential Same Type (Normal Usage, String , Buffer, file, IPs) -> Buffer overflow : [Buffer][permission] -> change the permission (compiler doesn't check) | buffer in os  and buffer in app
```c
int  A; 
int A[10]; //10 int member -> 4 * 10 = 40 byte 
char C[40]; // 40 * 1 = 40 byte in RAM but different cell size  

int D[5] = {1,2,3,4,6}; //initialize 

D[0]; // address + 0
D[1]; // address + 1 == in ASM address + 1*size(type) : pointer Arithmetic 


int E[5] = {1,2,3};
int F[] = {1,2,3} //F[3]

int x = 6;
int G[x]; // Dynamic Array size (one time you can use and it is runtime vs compile time which all aboves are | you can't change it later)

int H[2][3]; // 2D array : stored in memory in 1D : H[6] [][][] [][][] -> cell : H[1][2] : 1*3 + 2 = 5 in queue
int I[2][3][4]; // [][][][] [][][][] [][][][]   [][][][] [][][][] [][][][]


int J[2][3][] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} // you can only make one dim dynamic but don't do it for readability 

```
