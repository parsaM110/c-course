# session 4

aggregative data structure : Array, Struct, Enum, Union
## Array : 
Sequential Same Type (Normal Usage, String , Buffer, file, IPs) -> Buffer overflow : [Buffer][permission] -> change the permission (compiler doesn't check) | buffer in os  and buffer in app
```c
int  A; 
int A[10]; //10 int member -> 4 * 10 = 40 byte 
char C[40]; // 40 * 1 = 40 byte in RAM but different cell size  

int D[5] = {1,2,3,4,6}; //initialize 

D[0]; // address + 0
D[1]; // address + 1 == in ASM address + 1*size(type) : pointer Arithmetic 


int E[5] = {1,2,3};
int F[] = {1,2,3} //F[3]

int x = 6;
int G[x]; // Dynamic Array size (one time you can use and it is runtime vs compile time which all aboves are | you can't change it later)

int H[2][3]; // 2D array : stored in memory in 1D : H[6] [][][] [][][] -> cell : H[1][2] : 1*3 + 2 = 5 in queue
int I[2][3][4]; // [][][][] [][][][] [][][][]   [][][][] [][][][] [][][][]


int J[2][3][] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} // you can only make one dim dynamic but don't do it for readability 

```

## Struct
```c
struct Info {
    int v1;
    char c1;
    unsigned long long int v2;
}; // [4][1][8] stored in memory

// how to populate the struct
struct Info mydata; // you should constantly write `struct Info`

mydata.v1 = 10;
mydata.v2 = 1000;
mydata.c1 = 'A';

struct Info mydata2 = {10, 'A', 1000};

struct Info mydata3 = {.v2=1000, .v1=10, .c1='A'};

// or more beautiful

struct Info mydata3 = {
        .v2=1000,
        .v1=10, 
        .c1='A'
        };

struct Info data3[10]; //make array out of struct
data3[0].v1= 10;
data3[0].v2 = 1000;
data3[0].c1 = 'A';

data3[1].v1 = 10;
data3[1].v2 = 200;
data3[1].c1 = 'B';


// if we define an array in struct 
data3[0].items[0] = 1;
data3[0].items[1] = 1;
data3[0].items[2] = 1;
data3[0].items[3] = 1;


struct Point{
    int x,y;
} p1, p2={.x=0,.y=11}, p3;


// Anonymous Struct (Unnamed) Struct
struct {
    int x;
    char y;
} data6;

// I don't want to pass it to anywhere, I just use it as container 

```

## Enumerator (enum)
```c
enum Gender {MALE, FEMALE}; // it is a number in ASM (MALE=0, FEMALE=1)

enum Gender data;

data = MALE;
data = FEMALE;

// no enumerator can have the same value : cant use MALE again in any enum
// so it is standard to use 

enum Gender {GENDER_MALE, GENDER_FEMALE};

```


## Union
it is look like a Struct but actually it is a dynamic data type
```C
union Value {
    int a;
    double b;
};
// so you either want to put a int(4) or double(8) so I give you 8 byte

Union Value data;

data.b = 12.5 // data is now 12.5

data.a = 12 // data is now 12

// it is good for format files or protocol 
```
- ip packet ip n/c field is 0 it is tcp if 1 it is udp
- or we made an address which accept both ipv4 and ipv6
- but it occupy a lot of space and not used in system programming

## Procedure

func without return value
- you need it in multithread programming  
- c doesn't have Exception handler 
- return value is important and if you omit it you not showing errors
```c
void test(){
}
```

## String
- `''` is for char and should be only one char
- `""` is for string
- String: "ABCD" -> const char[5] -> it stored in code segment, not DS, heap or stack -> [A][B][C][D][0] -> [65][66][67][68][0]
- the last thing is null char
```c
man 7 ascii
```

hard coded strings are `attack surface`.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){


    // char b[] = "secret";
    char *b = "secret";
    printf("%s\n", b);
    return 0;
}
```
after compiling with gcc you can see the secret in binary:
```bash
strings ./04 | grep secret
```
i.e. server address, password, token

but you can obfuscate the code, encode or encrypt the data with `armadillo` which uses AES and bycrypt. or even add honey pot and misleading strings, these method mostly prevent cold analysis but again with warm analysis you can find it.

other method for defining strings:
```c
char msg[] = {'s','h','i','t', 0};
```
- adding C-string `\0` is for stop.  which is not deliminator but terminator. it is called `Null Terminated String`
- "shit" it self adding the `\0`, so it is 5 byte.

## linux manual 

- 1: application 
- 2: syscall(kernel) : (c functions defined in linux) not working on other os like windows, freebsd or solaris
- 3: standard library (std) : based on POSIX standard(libc)
- 4,5,6 is for game and other stuff
- 7 is for everything else like assci, signal

like :
```sh
man 1 grep
```
```sh
man 2 open
```
```sh
man 3 fopen
```
```sh
man 7 singal # signal and ipc
```
in linux we refer APIs or defined functions and libraries as `interface` or `ABI` (application binary interface)
```sh
ldd test
```
this command shows the libraries you have linked(gcc default link the standard | for writing firmware you have to tell compiler to link the std)

the standard library for c is glibc, which is for gnu and is the worst:
[link](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html)

- kernel gives you 380 func 
- std gives 2000 func

[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linux_kernel_System_Call_Interface_and_glibc.svg)

namespace gives you routing table  but is only linux specific.

### installing libraries
most libraries have lib prefix except like openssl which got it in code but not in package
```
sudo apt install libcurl
```
for example
- for http we got two `libcurl` and `libhttp`
- you should for compiling the code install `libcurl4-openssl-dev` 
- now when someone receives your binary and want to run the bin file should install `libcurl4` for runtime


gplv3 if you use you should opensource the whole application
```
locate string.h
````

- in compile step : you need header file
- in link step : you need object file

## pointer

- pointer with 0 is null pointer or invalid pointer
- every var in definition have * is a pointer
- size of pointer is about size of system arch (if 64bit it is 64)

```c
int *ptr; // says pointer target is int! why because must know how much byte it should read

int *p1 = NULL; //more readable than 0 (NULL is 0 macro)

void *p2; //unknown target type (used for Generic)
```
both is correct:
```c
int *z1; //is better
int* z1;

//but in this case
int* z3, z4; //z4 is integer and not pointer and some compilers gives you error
```
for populate the address in pointer:
```c
int *data = NULL;

int test = 10;

data = &test; //& in front of everything means its address
// data is in stack because it is auto
// test is also in stack because it is auto

printf("%d\n", *data); //* in using means the target (Dereference)

```
- Invalid pointer -> Dangling pointer (critical BUG)
- pointer is the only method if you want to use heap
