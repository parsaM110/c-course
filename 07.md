# functions review
read the error :
```
man fread
```

`size_t` is for understating error handing , if there is an error it returns zero

or in 
```
man malloc
```
also NULL returning means error 

so writing function in format of :
```
int fn(...)
```
you can return number for error handling like `statvfs` 


your function should never return pointer, because if it be a local variable it would become a dangling pointer:
```
int *fn(...)
```


for malloc also if you malloc you should free , there is two errors happen one memory lick (nobody frees the memory), or double free (two guys free the memory | security issue happen) 


it is better to return a pointer to pointer

for substring I return the place of that substring, i don't allocate anything like `strstr`

for pointer2pointer like
```
int **fn(...)
```
which is like a list of strings for example : `char **fn(...)`
- if you ever see sth like this
```
void fn(int *ptr)
```
it means they want to pass container to fill by function and it is complex DS not like `integer` or `float` to return, it is `array` or `structure` like `strcpy`

- in here 
```
void fn(int **ptr)
```
you want to change the pointer of this like `realloc` or `ptheard_join` because it want to get a container of pointer which retval data of another thread which is pointer in memory


remember :
```c
int ft(void *b){

    unsigned char *ptr = b; //okay

    *ptr = b; // not okay, it is now dereferenced 
}
```

## String functions
- atoi (ascci into integer): not good!
- atol ()
- these two function doesn't have successful return and error handling
- instead use strtol which is better
- gets() is a bad function
- fgets() is better

## Searching in man
finds all - in text
```regex
/^\s*-
```

## Transfering 
- IPC (inter process communication) : two programs talk to each other:
    - Shared Memory (is fast and easy but race condition handling is done with mutex and semaphore)
    - MQ (message queue) you give message in format of structure to kernel and the other process get it from kernel (good for one-way communication)(and size of queue and message is constant) => RabbitMQ is message queue but not dependent to kernel - and you by http send data and it gives it to another
    - Unnamed Pipe : `cat file | grep ... | sed ...` (you need bash and programs cant decide themselves)
    
        you also open by `popen` in c code (and there is only one unnamed pipe but by mkfifo you can open named pipes as many as you want )
    - named Pipe : pipe file 
    mkfifo create pipe, pipes are fake file stored in RAM and kernel handle them
    ```
    mkfifo /tmp/mypipe
    ```
    you can see it by(p in begining and 0 size):
    ```
    ls -l /tmp/mypipe
    prw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Mar 27 19:39 /tmp/mypipe

    ```
    and by reading it get blocked until someone write something in pipe(-O means where to put the output):
    ```
    wget -i /tmp/mypipe -O/dev/null
    ```
    it is important that pipe is like ordinary file, then with every file can read file you can give them pipe
    and without using disk hard you connect two programs, now run 
    ```bash
    echo "http://google.com" > /tmp/mypipe
    ```
    suddenly it will now start to wget 
    
    there is a tool called socat, which opens a socket (from whatever virtual network interface ) and put everything in pipe, and you now can connect that to whatever program

    we got something called ntopng which is monitoring network interfaces and it uses pipes for transferring data

    the only problem is it is one way and it is not duplex (somebody writes and the other read) | and if two are reading from same pipe, it creates race condition, whoever reach first get the data and data is erased from the pipe
    - socket
        - Unix socket (like pipe but full duplex), it is better than pipe but your program should support it, the problem is, it is single machine and cant work under network
        - Barkley socket 
    - Network Socket (TCP, UDP)
        - raw socket (without valid connection) | in TCP there is 4 way handshake, first a syn comes you give ack then synack and now next packages is received (you want to listen onto something) or you want to have new protocol and not use TCP ( you create an IP packet and custom header and then raw socket)
        - API HTTP (REST, XMLRPC, JSONRPC, SOAP)
        - gRPC
    
    ## working with files
    - files (fd)
        - regular file (.txt, .mp4)
        - directory file (folders)
        - socket file
        - pipe file
        - link file
        - unknown file
        - block device (parallel) => you are blocked until a block of data comes | depreciated  
        - character device (serial) => like usb
        see 
        ```
        man inode
        ```
    - linux syscalls
        - open 
        - read/write
        - close
## open
- settings are configured by integers it means it is bit flag and you should use logical or operator
- it returns fd of opened file

## LIBC corespondents (cross Platform)
- fopen
- fread/fwrite
- fclose

## fopen
- returns file pointer structure
- modes are char that are used for append and create ....

## fclose 
- on fopen, kernel load the driver and give it an fd and store it in RAM
 
- there is an array of fd, kernel stores and is seen with `ulimit -a` so you should definitely close it , on hardware side you can see the limitation by `ulimit -Ha`
but if your program got close the kernel closes all files, if you want to write a service which is open in background for long time, you should definitely close it.

## file formats
- Text(t) -> is a number of Ascii or Unicode (encoding tables)
- Binary(b) -> it doesn't mean anything in encoding tables
- in windows these files are different but in macOS, solaris, freeBSD, linux they are all the same
- **everything is binary actually**, you can see it by forensic on your disk, even storing is like binary

- text files or when we open them with editors try to decode it by UTF-8(which is backward compatible with ASCII)
- you can use ghex or [others](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/edit-binary-files) to view data

## c functions
- most of commands in linux terminal have c library like `chmod`
- `ll` is aliased to ls, check that with `type ll`
- only root can change the file permission
- you can change permission of file which you are owner or write privilege or your group is the owner
```
ll testfile1.txt 
-rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 11 Mar 27 22:03 testfile1.txt
```
my user was ubuntu so it can change it, but if the user was different we can't change the permission

now if you change the owner :
```bash
sudo chown www-data:www-data testfile1.txt 
```
when you run the code you will get a error :
```bash
./07
Failed to open file
```
- if a function got two variations, always use function which get size because it is more robust to segmentation fault 

for copy we have two functions:
- memcpy
- strcat

measures:
- RAM: Byte
- Network : bit
- HARD : Block 
    file systems are using block , when you say go read one Byte , it goes an read a Block and then put the rest to garbage, each file can go and occupy multiple block, but each block belongs to one file, by smaller block size you have less occupation much more iteration for read the file and vice-versa

    so the mount different block size for different folders like 
        - for email server : small block size
        - for movie server : big block size(less aux )
        - var have high write (small block size)
        - /www/data have large file (big block size)
    
    - bootsector and floppy disk were 512 B
    - later systems become better it changed to 2048 B
    - now it is 4096B == 4 KB

```

now look at this copy 100MB data from disk takes 69 seconds:
```
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/out bs=1 count=100000000
100000000+0 records in
100000000+0 records out
100000000 bytes (100 MB, 95 MiB) copied, 65.0599 s, 1.5 MB/s
```
now look at this:
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/out bs=8192 count=25000
25000+0 records in
25000+0 records out
204800000 bytes (205 MB, 195 MiB) copied, 0.307132 s, 667 MB/s
```
always best performance come in multiple of block size
