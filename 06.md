## Debuggers
- debuggers for IDEs like vscode , ...
- DDD (data display debugger)
- gdb : for gcc
- lldb : for clnag
- you should compile your code in debug format and no cpu optimization
```
gcc -g 06.c -o 06
```
run gcb it by tui (terminal user interface):
```
gcb -tui ./06
```
## gdb instructions
- run (r) 
- break (b) : break point

adding break points
```
b main
```
```
b 25
```
then run `r`, for clear the break points:
```
clear 25
```
- next : step over and goes to next line (see function as line)
- step (s) : step into function
- nexti : next instruction on ASM file
- stepi : jump and function call
- print (p) : print the variable like :
```
p head
```  
- [gdb print out put formats](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_54.html) : e.g.
print as decimal
```bash
print /d head 
```
- print multiple variables:
```bash
p /a {head, tail, cur}
```
- x: [gdb memory exam](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_55.html)
```
x tmp
```
for reading bytes you can:

- b : byte
```
x /12b tmp
```
- h: 2 byte
- w: 4 byte
- g : 8 byte

for reading in hex :
```
x /12xb tmp
```
the data in stored also in little endian fashion(10 is 0x0a and 4 first byte is the variable):
```
0x5555555592a0: 0x0a    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x5555555592a8: 0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
```
- quit by first `kill` then 'q'
## security 
- core dumped is for reporting , if a program fails and kernel kill it , kernel whole of memory (heap, stack and code segment and data segment and dumped it to a file called core dump (all registers and states)) and this can be loaded to gdb to check the situation and replicate it
- core dump is security issue, because all confidential data is dumped too
- core dumped for application is only for memory part of application or is disabled or just for some specific vendors is enabled
- `rotated` is use for rotation of core dumped and then delete the file
- see user limitations:
```
ulimit -a
```
can be configured by sysconf in /etc/ulimit, or in systemd in newer systems
- `core file size              (blocks, -c) 0`  in `ulimit` shows core dumped is enabled or not
- `ulimit -c 5000` will give 5kB limit for allowed core dump
- unlimited : `ulimit -c unlimited` 
- these changes are temporary and unset with restart, change `etc/ulimit` or `systemd`

## sysctl
- see it with `vim /etc/sysctl.conf`
- manage it with `sysctl`
- see `cat /proc/` : is virtual file system (tempfs) which is not really exist , linux kernel uses to talk to user space
- `/dev/` and `/proc/`  is used to talk to linux kernel
- `/proc` have report of kernel settings and report:
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo 
```
this says how to save core dump config:
```
cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
```
output (it is piped with apport which is software for sending data to Canonical.ltc):
```
|/usr/share/apport/apport -p%p -s%s -c%c -d%d -P%P -u%u -g%g -- %E
```
change the saving core dump directory by:
```
echo '/tmp/lastcoredump' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
````
- see core manual by `man core` to see params you can pass and have
- now put these to save additional data:
```
echo '/tmp/core-%u-%p-%E' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
```
- this config is also temporary, go and change `core_pattern` param in `/etc/sysctl.conf`
> note that you have enabled `ulimit -c ulimited` for each active terminal you are trying to do core dump
- now if you (cause core dumped):
```bash
> ll /tmp/core*
-rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 442368 Mar 25 12:05 '/tmp/core-1000-33943-!home!ubuntu!code!test!06'
```
- now with gdb and compiled version of your code you can check the stats:
```
gdb -tui ./06 '/tmp/core-1000-33943-!home!ubuntu!code!test!06'
```
now when you run:
```
#0  0x0000612e6126c1a9 in linklist_add (H=0x0, data=10) at 06.c:21
```
the error is on line 21 (you can print variables and check the states)
- for quit there is no need to kill because it is not running in core dump mode, just loading state

## priority
- 1.CMD Args
- 2.ENV vars
- 3.Config files
- 4.STDIN

## Variadic
- all functions with ... in their definition with you can have infinite inputs
- all variadic should now in compile time how many param is getting

------------

- everything is file in linux
- there is 3 files on linux that opened for each proc 
    - standard input 0 (file number - file descriptor)
    - standard output 1
    - standard error 2 

- terminal config your app so all these 3 comes into one

## program running on OS
- run this program:
```
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
now go and find the pid:
```
pidof tail
```
there is folder for each proc in linux
```
ll /proc/44378/
```
- some of contents:
    - cwd -> /home/ubuntu/code/test/ : is a softlink to original dir of running the file (current forking of program)

    - environ -> list of environment variables used by the program
    - exe -> /usr/bin/tail* -> true address of program
    - ns -> if it is executed under linux network name spaces
    - root -> shows the program see the root (if it is shroot and jailed this shows the jailed folder )
    - cgroup -> kernel property which let you put limitations
    - **fd (file descriptor)**
- file systems :
    - kernel drivers (part of kernel)
    - fuse (file systems of users space)

- every hardware have a driver in linux
- for hard driver there is a driver
- there is also driver for hard format
    - NTFS
    - ext4
    - fat32
    - cofs
- write of kernel which is called from user-space
handle this and find to read on what partition and format 
    - the stack hierarchy 
    - you asked kernel
    - kernel ask fs
    - fs asked interface hard kernel
    - interface hard kernel writes
- if you want to add file-system
    - compile kernel from bare and add the new one to kernel file (static kernel driver) : it is monolithic (micro-service (micro-kernel) vs monolith : they make kernel plugin based)
    - write the kernel module (driver) and kernel load it (k mode) | using `insmode`, `rmod` and`modprob` (see the list by `lsmod`) | it has two issues:
        - you should compile the kernel module
        - you should have kernel header file modules
        - you need sudo access
        - if kernel module errors, system freeze and you can only restart
        - kernel module is hard
- kernel framework : your tool is running in user-space but is used in kernel ( fuse, dpkt, mac80211)
- fuse is framework let you to create file systems : like sshfs is build with fuse
- but for ssh, samba, amazon object stream  which have lots of network overhead use fuse
- file descriptor (file handle in windows) is 0 to 65535 and is unique for each and it is used in topple (pid, fd)
- in linux everything have file descriptor (because everything is file)
    - socket
    - device (usb , hard-drive)
    - directory
    - port
- `write` in c get a `fd` and can write on whatever it wants
- you can now see the `fd` in `/proc/<pid>`:
```
ls -al /proc/44378/fd

- these are softlink
- `/dev/` is virtual fs that all devices are here
     - HDD drives : 
        - `/dev/hda` 
        - `/dev/hdb`
        - `/dev/hdc`
        - `/dev/hda1` means partition 1 on first hdd
    - SSD drives :
        - `/dev/sda`
    - MVME drives :
        - `/dev/mvme`
    - serial port:
        - `/stty0` (serial tty : 1B 1B ) (usb is serial | in old we have parallel now we don't)
    - pts -> (pseudo terminal) (ctrl + s | ctrl  + q)
        - xterm
        - kterm
        - terminator
    
now basically you can see that in here
```
ls -al /proc/44378/fd

```
it says all 3 file descriptors(0,1,2) are connected to /pts/0 (standard input, output, error)

fd 3 : is a /var/log/systlog is file the tail itself opened and we say to show us

fd 4 : is for  notify which detects disk changes and we use it when syslog file changed it detects it


now if you run:
```
tail -f /var/log/syslog 2> /tmp/err
```
you put error fd in /tmp/err, and because I closed the previous tail program , the previous pid is not working anymore so instead:
```
ls -al /proc/$(pidof tail)/fd
```
```diff

lr-x------ 1 ubuntu ubuntu 64 Mar 27 12:17 4 -> anon_inode:inotify
```
and if your run (you could not write 1 there because the default is 1) nothing will get printed here because it is putting it in garbage:
```
tail -f /var/log/syslog 2> /tmp/err 1> /dev/null
```
and now if `ls -al /proc/$(pidof tail)/fd`:
```diff

```
one of the reasons when we close terminal application stop is that these fd become invalid, so for building service you should either disable the standard (i/o/e) by connecting to `/dev/null` or connecting to some place 

## Unix philosophy
- write microservice programs, don't write a single command do anything 
- write like programs can talk to each other (chaining rule)
`program | grep | sed ... | awk ...`
- output be human readable and have certain format
- is in pipe approach, all programs executed at ones or in order?

> answer: all are instantly run because other wise it should be stored in RAM and if output is big , RAM is fulfilled, and if program is persistent program it will waits until it fished to see the output , so if you want the output be like stream it should be executed instantly and (std output -> std input of next program) and will continue to be run until standard input of them is not finished (End of file mark is not transmitted (EOF))
(or be killed and fd is closed )

test this by :
```
sleep 5 | echo test
```
you will get test instantly

or give nothing to cat (std input will be terminal):
```
cat 
```
write Hello -> gives Hello
until you give ctrl + D

or 
```
cat < /var/log/syslog
```
read in c is designed to block on fd until there is std input
so like cat it waits until data comes

all data comes is buffered and is not like instantly
in terminal default buffer is line ending \n

so if you pipe to app will not receive anything until it reaches /n

## printf
```
man 3 printf
```

- linux is always stream and not block
make it sequential :
```
echo "uhwiudw" > /tmp/data && cat /tmp/data
```

socket and pipe are stream
shared memory is not , so you need to use mutex


client-server architecture : ipc , http , socket

signal-slot arch : when the job is done they send you acknowledge (this is what qt calls it, someplace else register-notify [django] | event-oriented)

- daemon is service that do nothing  is just there and gives service 

- IEEE754 says shouldn't do computation in floating point format make them decimal or scientific notation
