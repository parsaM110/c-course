## good c projects
- virtual network card
- tunnel traffic on network
- udp adaptor (like socat) connect unix-socket or file to a port and can change the file in meantime
- kernel network jobs which is only c
- encryption aes | des
- IEEE 80211S (wife) for mesh network 
- wireless networks
    - client to access point
    - access point, client connect to us
    - p2p (sharing like share-it)
    - mesh (which no body is access-point) - fully connect or not - both access-point and peer
    - other standard is batman which microtik uses
- embedded systems
    - zephyr
    - freertos
- esp
    - esp32 : dual core
    - esp8266 : one core
- write a virtual cpu on spartan
- it is built not on os but qemu emulator

## good book
- [linux programming interface](https://maktabkhooneh.org/mag/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Michael-Kerrisk.pdf)
- The Shellcoder's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Holes
- Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide
- challange me (crack me ) (ctf)

## security
- don't get out of array
- offensive 
    - how memory layout works(how protected, salted, randomized) -> how to hot-wire(shortcut) it by knowing it
- binary analysis books

## your user
- `id`
- `echo $USER`
- ~~`whois`~~ is for dns registery like `whois ir` gives you info of ir domain or even full address
- see the groups by `groups`

like in one terminal go:
```
sleep(120)
```
and in other write:
```
sudo ps -Af | grep sleep
```
now go an run:
```
pidof sleep
120092
```
now run:
```
ll /proc/120092
```
you see two folder `gid_map` and `uid_map` or `status`
```
cat /proc/$(pidof sleep)/status
```
see `Uid` and `Gid`
## users
- root
```
$id root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
all system privilege is for `root`

- for sending signals you should have the priviliage like `sudo kill -9 $(pidof sleep)`
## sending packets
### tcp connection
sending packet by `nc` and open tcp connection
```
nc -V smtp.google.com 25
```
~~google seems to be changed the address~~instead use `nc -v smtp.gmail.com 587` or 
:
```
$ sudo nc -v smtp.mail.yahoo.com 587
Connection to smtp.mail.yahoo.com (66.218.88.167) 587 port [tcp/submission] succeeded!
220 smtp.mail.yahoo.com ESMTP ready
>EHLO test.com
250-hermes--production-bf1-745f8664bc-xxs4b Hello test.com [217.218.44.72])
250-PIPELINING
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
250-8BITMIME
250-SIZE 41697280
250 STARTTLS
```
### open udp connection
```
$nc -v -u 8.8.8.8 53
Connection to 8.8.8.8 53 port [udp/domain] succeeded!
```
### listen to port
```
nc -v -l 127.0.0.1 10000
```
now you can connect by:
```
nc -v 127.0.0.1 10000 
Connection to 127.0.0.1 10000 port [tcp/webmin] succeeded!
```
but you can't :
```
nc -v -l 127.0.0.1 600
nc: Permission denied
```
all port below 1024 is privileged and `root` only can open them

## traceroute
```
sudo apt install traceroute
sudo apt remove inetutils-traceroute
```
traceroute is a technique to detect layer3 devices form here until destination
```
traceroute 8.8.8.8
```
it doesn't detect physical or network architecture, instead logical path, from which ip it passes, by `ttl` (time to live) in ip, and for each they subtract the ttl packet to prevent loop, now doping a packet for packets with 0 ttl is to create `icmp` by devices who drop, by that `icmp` we get the ip of that device

when the ttl of packet is 10 (it means after 10 packet it should be dropped) * menas the devices which drop and doesn't send the `icmp`

you can also get the forking by 3 packet it send

in `traceroute -T` I am trying to mimic real tcp by 443, Paris traceroute is a method of marking the packet to get more data and also need `sudo`

## sudo
in the program:
```
./15
UID: 1000
$ sudo ./15
UID: 0
```

## linux permissions:
```
ll
```
or
```
stat
```
the permissions:
- Sticky bit: only for folders|you can build but can change only folders that yourself build, good for shared folder, like `ll -d /tmp`
- SUID: run owner = file owner
```
$stat 15

$./15
UID: 1000
```
means each file is run by the user it run it
for changing `setuid` and `setgid`
I want to give it `suid` by :
```
sudo chmod 4755 ./15
```
now if you `ll` from it, it is red:
```
stat ./15
  File: ./15
  Size: 16000     	Blocks: 32         IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fc00h/64512d	Inode: 11299565    Links: 1
Access: (4755/-rwsr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
Access: 2025-04-02 02:47:04.691925126 +0330

 Birth: 2025-04-02 02:38:33.299250477 +0330
```
now if you run:
```
$./15
UID: 1000
EUID: 1000
```
we have two `userid`, the real user run it, the effective uid that reaches us.
now change it to normal by:
```
sudo chmod 755 ./15
```
if you change owner the s will drop too:
```
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu ./15
```

> how to change effective uer id?
- run by root
- ran by sudo
- it be run by root and have set-uid
```
$ ll /usr/bin/ping
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 76672 Feb  5  2022 /usr/bin/ping*
$ which sudo
/usr/bin/sudo
$ ll /usr/bin/sudo
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 232416 Apr  3  2023 /usr/bin/sudo*
```
sudo have set-uid and means it is always root
- SGID

## how it relates?
some works need root:
- open tcp port and webserver needs `root`. if we get bugged, we are screwed: buffer overflow, stack overflow, remote code execution 
- if you can never use root permission you are always safe
- when your job ends return the privilege to system with `seteuid`

now look 
```
$id www-data
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
so now if we run:
```
 ./15
UID: 1000
EUID: 1000
UID: 1000
EUID: 1000
$ sudo ./15
UID: 0
EUID: 0
UID: 0
EUID: 33
``
many programs ask with which privilege you want to run , they drop their privilege after doing necessary jobs by `seteuid`
