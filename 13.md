## production
- main.c -> exec
- main.c -> main.0 --- lnk --> exec
    libs[...] -> *.o
```
gcc -c *.c
```
it creates .o files then:
```
gcc \*.o -o program
```
or
```
gcc */*.c
```
or you might if you want only compile changed files
main.c, libprocess.c, libdata.c, test.c
main.o, libprocess.o, libdata.o, test.o

- need an automated system to recompile changed sources

Need a system to atomized the deployment installation, test, ...

## Makefile: instruction for target
- is like windows installer
- make files: bash script and a4 MACRO

targets:
- phony : no real files on disk(is not checked)
- ordinary
