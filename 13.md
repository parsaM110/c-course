## production
- main.c -> exec
- main.c -> main.0 --- lnk --> exec
    libs[...] -> *.o
```
gcc -c *.c
```
it creates .o files then:
```
gcc \*.o -o program
```
or
```
gcc */*.c
```
or you might if you want only compile changed files
main.c, libprocess.c, libdata.c, test.c
main.o, libprocess.o, libdata.o, test.o

- need an automated system to recompile changed sources

Need a system to atomized the deployment installation, test, ...

## Makefile: instruction for target
- is like windows installer
- make files: bash script and a4 MACRO
- make files is hard and for different targets and install before that and ...
- it is easy but jobs are complex
- use makefilegenerator

targets:
- phony : no real files on disk(is not checked)
- ordinary

## Makefile generator
- Automake
    - Autoconf -> configure.ac (sometime have .sh extension)
    - linux programs mostly use ./configure
    - m4 lang
    - configure -> Makefile 
    - Makefile -> exec
    - more tools it have
- CMake
    - CmakeLists.txt -> Makefile (automatically) -> exec
    - it is easy : `add_executable(myapp main.c)`
    - easy and straightforward (opencv used it)


## usage
-Automake
    - no configure: (configure.ac)
    - autoconf
        - ./configure --without-q  (without quantum .e.g)
        - make --with-ssl
        - make install
- cmake
    - cmake --with-ssl -j4

- ninja (doesn't get popular)


## review about fork
- lazy load (copy-on-write)
- before posix thread was only method
- only for unix systems
- forked functions causes 
- fork only work on OS linux, not work on firmware (bare metal)
- fork usage
    - network
    - service

## network
- in network each process do something
- Apache : listen (80) -> req  (500ms) if a new request comes what happen?
- you will get connection refused, you are engaged
- os help us by keeping packets and request in its buffer and we don't get instantly connection refused 
- so in buffer we are now in timeout , if gonna wait 1 second, 2 second until the process is freed, even 30 seconds
- ngnix can answer 1 million req so 1 process really can answer all thing, so for a large file
- all other requset gonna get timeout

- they gonna fork, fork, fork (5 nginx)
- linux reuseaddr, reuseport (one is for listen to connection that still is not terminated ) of enabled let 5 nginx simultaneously work

- chrome://net-internals
- chrome don't fork the process  if one tab crash others nothing happen (more memory usage)
- firefox opens a thread,so one tab crash whole thing crash



## service
- service in linux means init, systemd handles the process-> reads form file : /etc/init.d/ or /etc/systemd/services/ like dns or gui services and is run by them

- if init or systemd execute a process std(i,o,e) will determine what to do:
- systemd : connect std input to `/null` and std error and output to itself in system journal control seen as log

- if systemd or init got stopped system will restart

# linux rule
- child stopped -> Parent must get information of exit
- child stopped -> if not -> Zombie (parent is stuck and didn't get the info) -> resources will not get freed (if parent already register signal for it)
- processing the exit info:
    - os give parent a signal and parent answer -> child will stopped and resource freed
    - if there is no signal registered  for child, OS handle it (for not registered child zombie will not happen)
- signal : the method os talk to process (is kind of software interrupt)
- parent will stuck like is waiting for TCP connection, meanwhile his child is existed
- defunc process are zombies in `htop`, `top` or `ps`


- they say you can't do anything with zombie, but if you can find parent, you can do it other than restart 


- if parent exit, but child don't exit:
    - child is not dependent on parent resource (thats how it will not get exited by parent exit)

    ```
    sleep 100 < /dev/zero >/dev/null 2>&1
    ```
    like now if you run it you will make process std out,in,error independent of terminal so you can exit the terminal

    so OS will : child -> init (forking)


    ## running sample code
    ```
    gcc 13.c -o prog13
    ./prog13
    ```
    now in htop filter(f4) prog13 and also turn on ppid(parent pid) col
    


    now in some distros the ppid become 1 in orphan while is some it [doesn't](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77070933/why-are-orphaned-child-processes-not-adopted-by-pid-1-in-linux-like-it-is-claim)

    read this might be helpful [too](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40424031/why-do-processes-i-fork-get-systemd-as-their-parent).

    run :
    ```
    pgrep systemd
    ```

    ## is it still necessary?
    in time of manual and init era you need to fork, but now in systemd era you can no need to do this by type of process(forking, simple)

    ## signal
    - signal in  software interrupt
        - stop your assembly and change instruction point and says go do this and then back (like function call)
    - `kill` is a command to send signal to process
    - signals are sent in two ways:
        - OS: when something happens
        - User: kill(kill is not for killing is for sending signals)
    - signals
        - Manageable
            - SIGINT (soft shutdown): ctrl + c -> some programs can bypass and resist because it is manageable
            - SIGUSR1 : is a custom signal you can give 
                like in tor:`sudo apt install tor` and 
                ```
                man tor
                ```
                sending this will write the log
            - SIGHUP1 (in tor) : update config without stop or restart like ngnix which laod the config 
        - Unmanageable -> you can't get them, you can't notice them or even stop them
            - (SIGKILL) : like 9 signal which is killing -> which OS instantly exit your process
            - (SIGSTOP) : stop your process (ctrl + z : cause stop and go to background)
            - (SIGCONT) : fg or bg command to continue all stopped processes
            - (SIGSMTFLT) (SIGSLFT) (SIGSERVE): segmentation fault 
            - stacksmashing
            - division by zero

    ### default behavior of signals:
    - Ignore(ING) : give to a process and process doesn't process it nothing happen, like `SIGUSER1` which if it is not defined the OS will leave it
    - Terminate (Term) : like `SIGINT` if process doesn't process the signal it will get terminated:

see it in :
```
man 7 signal
```
- always call by signal macro in C because in different arch the number is different

## how to handle signal
```
man 2 signal
```
- handler is a function pointer and is used in signal
